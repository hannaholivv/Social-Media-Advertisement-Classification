# Social Media Advertisement Classification
This project aims to address the problem of inaccurate targeting in social media advertising, which can lead to wasted advertising budgets, low conversion rates, and poor return on investment (ROI) for businesses. By accurately classifying social media users, businesses can target their advertising efforts more effectively, leading to higher revenue and customer satisfaction.
## Problems
**Wasted Advertising Budget:** Without accurate targeting, businesses may end up spending their advertising budget on audiences that are unlikely to convert, resulting in wasted resources.

**Low Conversion Rates:** Inaccurate targeting can lead to low conversion rates, as ads may not reach the most relevant and profitable customers.

**Poor Customer Experience:** Irrelevant ads can create a poor customer experience, decreasing customer engagement with the platform and potentially leading to negative brand perception.
Reasons

**Optimized Advertising Spend:** Accurate targeting helps businesses avoid wasting advertising spend on audiences that are unlikely to convert. By directing their resources towards the most profitable customers, businesses can achieve higher revenue and sustainable growth.
Improved Customer Satisfaction: Showing relevant and engaging ads to customers enhances their satisfaction with the platform. Satisfied customers are more likely to make repeat purchases and become loyal brand advocates.
## Project Implementation
The project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify social media users based on their characteristics. 

The following steps are involved:

**Data Loading and Exploration:** The project begins by loading the necessary packages and reading the data from the provided CSV file. Initial data exploration is conducted to gain insights into the dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:** Data quality checks are performed to identify and handle missing values. Histograms are created to visualize the distribution of product purchases based on age and estimated salary.

**Model Training:** The input features (age and estimated salary) and the target variable (purchased or not) are prepared. The data is split into training and testing sets. A decision tree classifier model is trained using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Predictions are made on the testing set using the trained model. A classification report is generated to assess the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Limitations

**Limited Data:** The project acknowledges the limitation of working with a limited dataset, which may affect the model's accuracy and generalizability.
Data Quality Issues: Data quality issues can impact the reliability of the results. It is essential to address and mitigate any data quality concerns.

**Rapidly Changing Social Media Landscape:** The project recognizes that the social media landscape is dynamic, with evolving user behaviors and platforms. Regular updates and adaptations may be required to maintain the model's effectiveness.

**Complexity of Machine Learning Models:** The project utilizes a decision tree classifier, which may have limitations in handling complex relationships in the data. Alternate models or ensemble techniques could be explored for improved performance.
